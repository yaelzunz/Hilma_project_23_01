It's damning - It's All Kicking Off By Michael Pavitt For Mailonline Published: 15:54, 13 January 2024 | Updated: 16:47, 13 January 2024 e-mail 19 View comments Reading's League One match against Port Vale has been abandoned after supporters stage a mass pitch invasion to protest against the club's owner Dai Yongge. The pitch invasion took place in the 16th minute of the match with the score goalless - with the time highlighting the 16 points the Royals have been deducted under Dai's ownership. Footage from the stands showing hundreds of fans running onto the pitch having earlier thrown tennis balls onto the pitch. Reading made repeated pleas with their supporters to leave the field prior to the abandonment, but acknowledged their frustrations. 'We are fully aware of and understand our supporters’ frustrations, but we must reiterate to our supporters that entering or throwing items onto the pitch can put the fixture at risk of abandonment and can result in personal consequences including banning orders,' a statement read. 'Thank you for your support today.'

In a subsequent update the club said there was a 'last chance' to get the match played. 'Both sets of team staff and players wish to get today's game played to a conclusion,' a statement read. 'This is the last chance to get the game restarted. The club can face serious sanctions if the pitch is not cleared.' Reading also made two announcements over the PA system, stating that once that fans return to the stands the match can resume. Supporters remained on the pitch for over an hour, before confirmation that the match had been abandoned. The Sell Before We Dai fan group, which is aimed at pushing owner Dai to leave the club, insisted the action was 'just the start'. 'We shouldn't be doing this. We should be enjoying the game with friends and family,' the group tweeted. 'This is just the start Dai. We are coming for you. So do yourself a favour and sell.' The group also thanked Port Vale supporters for their backing of protest action on the pitch.

Port Vale supporters were also heard chanting 'Get out of their club'. Reading are currently 21st in League One after being hit with a four-point deduction in August.

The EFL had pushed for Dai to be disqualified from all football activity for 12 months, including ownership and control. An independent Disciplinary Commission instead fined Dai a total of £20,000, with a further £50,000 suspended and to be activated on 12 January 2024 unless the required deposit is made in full. The Disciplinary Commission had labelled Dai's handling of matters as a ‘serious case‘ and ‘deliberate misconduct.’ Share or comment on this article: Reading fans stage extraordinary mass PITCH INVASION to protest against owner Dai Yongge - leading to match being abandoned - after stricken club had pleaded with supporters to get off the turf e-mail Add comment Comments 19 Share what you think Newest Oldest Best rated Worst rated View all The comments below have not been moderated.
